Labour and the Greens say they're committed to running budget surpluses, paying debt and keeping spending down. The two parties will present their 'Budget Responsibility Rules' to business leaders, economists, NGOs and academics on Friday morning. "People want to know the kinds of principles that we're going to manage the books by," Labour leader Andrew Little told The AM Show. The two parties' economic policies have differed in the past, and while they'll still have separate policies, the rules are a "framework" for working together in government, said Labour finance spokesman Grant Robertson. Among the rules are: running surpluses (barring major economic shocks or natural disasters) keep Crown spending to about 30 percent of GDP a progressive, fairer tax system reduce net debt to 20 percent of GDP in five years increase investment in superannuation, climate change and infrastructure. "We're committed to running surpluses over an economic cycle," says Mr Little. "We're going to be responsible with the government budget. There's stuff we've already committed to - we've got to fix housing, we've got to fix health, we've got to fix education." Crown spending currently is at 30 percent of GDP, according to Treasury figures. The 2016 Budget predicted it would drop to about 28 percent by 2020, under National. It peaked in 2011, in the wake of the global financial crisis, at around 34 percent. The last time Labour was in government, Finance Minister Michael Cullen ran up a series of significant surpluses, but came under fire for not cutting taxes. No tax increases are planned if Labour does win the upcoming election. "Every commitment we've made we can fund out of existing tax revenue," said Mr Little. The Greens went into the last election promising a new top tax rate of 40 percent on income over $140,000. Co-leader James Shaw wouldn't say if that would be the case this year, saying the party's focus wouldn't be on income tax. "A lot of people don't know this, but at the last election we actually promised a tax cut for 97 percent of New Zealanders," he told The AM Show. "That was going to be funded out of a tax on pollution that causes climate change." A capital gains tax would likely be included in the Greens' economic policy, but not Labour's. "It won't be exactly the same as what we've said in the past," said Mr Shaw. Coalition negotiations As for who'll take what job should the left bloc win the election, Mr Shaw says it's wide open. "The largest party in government is guaranteed the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. Everything else depends on what happens on election night."
DOWNEY, Calif. When Mario Guerra strolls through the streets of downtown Downey, he cant help but play the role of seasoned salesman for the city in southeastern Los Angeles County he adopted more than 35 years ago. Guerra, a Cuban-American immigrant who served eight years on the city council and two terms as mayor, sings the praises of Portos Bakery, a Cuban sandwich and pastry shop that he helped lure to Downey. He shows off the vibrant murals and sleekly designed street sculpture that he commissioned as a city leader to spruce up the downtown area and imbue it with a sense of culture and character. Subsequently, an acquaintance stops Guerra, known about town for his role as a Catholic deacon as well as consummate problem-solver, to ask if Guerra would perform his wedding at the towns annual Dia de los Muertes festival. Guerra, a Republican in a city that is 70 percent Hispanic and leans Democratic, attributes his success as a GOP politician to a laser-like focus on finding solutions, building bridges and approaching every problem with a kind of neighborly compassion. Its how Guerra says he came within 5 percentage points of his opponent in his race for a state Senate seat last fall in a district where Democrats have a 24-point voter registration advantage I govern in that 60 to 70 percent where I feel that we can all agree and say, Lets just make things better, he said. Were not going to agree on everything but we can agree on this stuff that we can fix, and its in that space that you can get things done. But to Guerras dismay, its a markedly different philosophy than the one that seems to have taken hold within the Republican Party at the national level in the 2016 presidential cycle, particularly with the rise of Donald Trump. Guerra has watched with a mixture of bewilderment and exasperation as the business mogul has ridden to the top of the polls in part by spewing barbed invective against illegal immigration, and branding Latino immigrants as criminals and rapists. In preparation of going on Spanish-language television to talk about the summer of Trump, Guerra brushed up to make sure he had one specific word in his arsenal payaso clown. For Californians, the narrative playing out at the national level has an air of dj vu. Twenty years ago, a similar wave of anti-immigrant sentiment washed over the Golden State, and voters responded by passing a ballot initiative that blocked undocumented immigrants from receiving a litany of critical state services, including public education and health care.
Let's just get something out of the way: the Phillies are not a good baseball team. Ryan Howard is listed as the number one starter at first base on the depth chart, and it's not 2009. Freddy Galvis and Cesar Hernandez compose the middle infield; Cedric Hunter and Peter Bourjos are the starting corner outfielders. Those are five players that shouldn't be starters, starting, but this is the reality that the Phillies currently inhabit. Fortunately for Philadelphia, and their fans, they have already have the pieces in place to help them make a quantum leap. Through a series of trades, and good drafts, the Phillies are in a position to put a competitive baseball team on the field as early as 2017. Homegrown players Philadelphia has two players that have come through their own farm system and that could be ready as soon as this year: J.P. Crawford and Andrew Knapp. 2015 PA BB% K% ISO wOBA wRC+ Crawford (AA) 405 12.1% 11.1% .142 .348 121 Andrew Knapp (AA) 241 9.1% 17.8% .271 .465 200 Both players spent the majority of their 2015 seasons in AA, and they were fantastic. Knapp, a catcher, showcased more power and a better offensive line overall, but in no way should that diminish Crawford's campaign. FanGraphs rates his future value at 60 (out of 80), and he's expected to be the next shortstop prospect to join the surfeit of budding MLB stars at that position. He's starting the year at AA, but with a current wOBA of .421 and a wRC+ of 164 though 43 at-bats, he's likely going to join Knapp at AAA relatively soon. The Phillies don't want to start anyone's service clock sooner than they have to, but Knapp seems like a safe bet to see time at the major league level this year. Carlos Ruiz (likely) won't be playing for Philadelphia beyond this year, and Cameron Rupp (with his career wOBA of .282 and wRC+ of 75) isn't going to block Knapp from reaching the big leagues. The catcher's spot is up for grabs on the big league club, and Knapp has a chance to entrench himself as the starter. There's also Aaron Nola, who's already at the big league level. In the first 91.2 innings of his career, Nola's posted a K/9 of 8.35 and a BB/9 of 1.87, along with an ERA of 3.53, an FIP of 3.81, and an fWAR of 1.3. In two starts this year, he's striking out a significantly higher percentage of batters than he did in 2015, and has yet to walk anybody. He's under team control through the 2021 season, and barring an injury, Nola should be one of the Phillies' front line starters for years to come. Philadelphia also has Aaron Altherr (currently on the DL) and Roman Quinn moving up through their system.
Is it possible to completely eliminate scent? Share this article Every day a new scent control product seems to hit the market. How do you make sense of the marketing tidal wave that hits you every time you turn on the T.V. or open a hunting magazine? Do scent control products actually work? Is it possible to completely eliminate odor? Maybe. In this article, I will uncover the answers to those questions and determine the best way to remain undetected in the field. How animals smell Animals have special membranes in their noses that pick up scent signatures in the air. In fact, deer and elk have more receptors in their noses than even dogs. Deer and elk can also use an additional organ in their mouth, called a vomeronasal organ, to detect smells. This allows them to detect multiple scents simultaneously and makes it possible for them to detect smells that are incredibly far away. This means that the proverbial deck is stacked against a hunter almost immediately because animals can smell you before you ever see them. Types of scent It will be easiest to understand scent control if we first understand scent in general. There are three types of scents that comprise the smells that an animal will pick up: natural, unnatural/foreign and odor. Natural Natural smells are those smells that naturally occur in its given environment. The smell of pine trees, the smell of a deer's coat, etc.; however, natural smells are not just those smells that are found in nature. Human beings also have a natural smell even though we do not actually smell it. This is because our brains recognize it as our own scent and the way we are programmed, it becomes useless information that does not register for us. But that does not mean that it is not there. I could shower with scentless soap and scentless shampoo and I would still have a natural scent. Natural scents cannot be removed; they can only be masked. Unnatural/foreign Unnatural or foreign smells are those that are not naturally occurring. Scented detergents might be mountain fresh, but in the woods in the fall that smell is unnatural. Coffee is an unnatural smell as well as vehicle exhaust. Unnatural scents can be removed with little effort. Simply by being aware of these unnatural or foreign smells is enough to make changes that can drastically reduce or eliminate them. Odor Odor is a specific type of scent because it is caused by the growth of bacteria in an environment. Sweat does not smell like body odor until it stays in a dark, wet area of your body (i.e., your armpit) for an extended period of time and bacteria begins to grow.

It dominated its neighbors and basked in glory. The Victorians made remarkable technological achievements in steam-powered machinery. Imperial airships flew over the many lands and provinces under its control. The foundation of the Empires power was the celebrium trees growing on the Acribo Islands. Its precious sap fueled its technological wonders, but the empire had a dark secret. Harvesting the sap of the trees drove the workers mad. Day after day, the Acribian laborers slaved away in nightmarish conditions, all for the sake of harvesting the cursed tree. A storm was brewing that could not be seen from above, and one day, everything changed. The ancient gods of the Acribo Islands returned and took revenge on the Victorians exploiting their people. Devastating cataclysms struck the land. Having suffered long under the yoke of the Empire, the Acribians rebelled in a war that nearly drowned the country in blood, and they declared their independence. The world was never the same. Time passed. The crisis was over, but the Empires greatness was gone. So was its industry, and the lives of so many of its citizens. It lost its access to the celebrium trees. But now, Victoria is healing its wounds and it is time to take action. All that remains of its air force is mustering and the Imperial airships are headed West. This is where your story begins. Bring the Empire back to its former glory! You must win whatever it takes.
